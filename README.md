### **Project Description:**    
  For our project, we will create a smart mirror that will display temperature, weather, and spotify album covers to the user. We drew inspiration from LuLuLemon's smart mirrors at their stores and also from the SmartMirror app. In addition, the mirror should turn on and off when a user passes in front or away from it.    
  
### **Materials:**
To develop our project, we are using a raspberry pi, a motion senor, desktop monitor, and a one way mirror. We will download and install SenseHat and use this as a base for displaying images, sensor tracking, and etc.
